FWT was set up in the late 1980s to address the disadvantage faced by socially excluded women through education, training and enterprise. It provided locally based women-led services in a women-centred environment. It emphasized the importance of supporting marginalized women to become active citizens in their communities, localities and wider society. In its history, FWT has faced many challenges - withdrawal of its funding by the city council in the late 1990s, the marginalization of women’s needs in policy agendas, the complex dynamics of exclusions based on racism, sexism, ‘culture’ and religion. It has also been presented with numerous opportunities to achieve its vision.  The drive, commitment, and strength of all the women involved over the years have ensured that FWT remains a valued part of the landscape of the city and a crucial home for women seeking to have a voice in the city.

‘While FWT acts as an important forum for education and training, it is also a space where women create networks of friendship and support… the reputation and good work of our organization is spread through word of mouth where women themselves become the spokespeople for FWT’ (Looking Back and Facing Forward, FWT Annual Report, 2000).

‘And then in the early 2000s, we applied for funding along with Sahil, which was another women’s organisation, the manager there and I put in a bid to set up the Mamta Project, which was about maternal healthcare. That was because there was research done that showed that infant mortality in our community was really high. So this was an intervention about levelling the playing field for the women. So that was a success and it's still going and it has now been taken over by the NHS Trust as a kind of mainstream project. I think they recognise that it was instrumental as a project in bringing the infant mortality rate in the community down’. 

‘We're still doing the work, still interested in refugees and migrants. Of course, FWT had a lot of focus on training the women, but then when you move into social enterprise you have to think okay you have this skill but how do you enter into the market? Because getting the women into the labour market was very difficult, there were of course many barriers, but the question was, how can we give them enough agency to start something for themselves to support their families with the skills they have brought into this country?’

It provided an important avenue especially for Muslim women to strengthen their skills, such as sewing, and begin new avenues of employment.  

‘At Barr’s Hill the two women who led that project were 100% committed to it, looking at the migrant issues through their eyes and looking at the issues around skills and employment of women. We had one small sewing group that Muslim women got trained in, we had keep fit and Giddah’.                                                   
Social gatherings were central to building confidence and social networks away from domestic responsibilities. These social scenes were zones for learning new skills and developing friendships and offered independent ways of being in public spaces together as women. Social spaces for enjoying festivities, with food and song, across different religions, were a vital element of most women’s projects and were organised by all the different organisations and sometimes together. These initiatives were both for and led by South Asian women across the generations. 

Trips and outings were regularly organised and a huge pull factor for women to leave their homes and create spaces of fun and laughter. Often workers had to talk to families so that they could develop trust in them as the facilitators of these social gatherings. Seaside trips and visits abroad required considerable organisation; the joviality of these outings is still remembered by participants today. They have become significant scenes in our biographies of making space for ourselves in the UK, beyond both the strictures of family life as well as the borders of racism."

They initially met in different buildings that provided health services, before securing a regular weekly base in a small room at St Paul’s Church. Initially starting with 10-15 women, the group built up to over a hundred members, and has been recognised through numerous awards. It became a hub for alternative therapies, such as yoga, massage, knitting, crafts and relaxation sessions, as well as regular trips abroad and Singing for the Brain. All of these activities encouraged friendships and confidence. Over time the, the focus, funding opportunities and governance structures have changed from the original vision.

‘We managed to get seed funding initially and then other large funding grants over the years. To become a member with voting rights £5 contribution for the year which gave voting rights. The intention that any money £1 contribution each session would be put in a reserve a contingency and encourage ownership’. 

‘In 2001, the NHS South Asian mental health service practitioners successfully secured funding from the Single Regeneration Board (SRB), for the Asian Mental Health Access Project, with six project workers, identified with outreach, education and training, carers, young people and perinatal work’.

‘I ensured, alongside the chair, who incidentally, changed the name to Ekta, that the constitution stated that paid members were listened to, ensuring the management could not change anything without the vote of members’. "

It recognised that women in the community could be supporters and draw on their own experiences to form supportive connections with women.

Supported only for three years, it was Asian women community activists that ensured the project continued beyond this time. Sahil continues to be a source of advice and wellbeing support for many in the city and beyond.

‘We found that they were shutting it up after the three years. Back then when we would talk to the social services, it was always all about targets, there was no other way to measure goals. It was horrible, always talking in numbers, how many women have you gotten to use certain services, sort of labelling people. And we were trying to convince them that the need is still there’.

Panahghar ,Organisations, Address kept confidential,52.41220485,-1.510456858,https://www.safehouse.org.uk/,,,PN_audio2.mp4,,,,,"Domestic violence is better known and recognised today but in the 1980s and early 1990s, it was still largely seen as a ‘private’ issue. Specialist support services for South Asian women were developing nationally, as part of Black feminist activism challenging violence against women, but were still few. South Asian community leaders denied the existence of domestic violence in their communities and the problem remained largely hidden. In Coventry, the gap in help for South Asian women and children was recognised and the seeds sown for Panahghar in the late 1980s. The Panahghar refuge services provided, and continue to provide, an important lifeline to escape violence and abuse for women and their children.

 ‘The Haven project was already out there, and they wanted to do something, like a pilot project with Asian women. So I was appointed and I worked with the Haven and social services to set up the pilot. And then we got more funding. Around then was when I had the run-in with the [Asian] councillor, who was a very popular community leader, and he was knocking this project. He was blocking our application… … Women came to us through social services at the time, so if a woman had domestic violence they referred them on to us… what we did… it was all dependant on the context because in some cases you could really clearly see that the woman should not go back, but sometimes the women were traditional, or wanted to go back, and instead of bringing them out of the family and then leaving them out cold in a world they were not equipped to handle, we tried to talk to the families. But the other organisations did not like us for that.' 

‘We also used to do some work running groups at Frank Walsh House, which were women’s support groups … It was quite good, we used to have trips, we would go and talk to the families to let the women come on their own.’

The women remember this spot fondly; they started their trip to Glasgow from this point (For more on this, see St Paul's Community Centre on the map). Location was also key to the importance of Frank Walsh House as a meeting place; it was close to temples, gurudwaras, and mosques, and thus served as a focal point for the community."

The groups meeting at church were often used to receive the information on home working projects. The Shanti Bhavan ladies group, now known as Ekta Unity, met here every Monday in one of the small rooms attached to St Paul’s church. The group was able to use the kitchen and was given storage facilities. At the time when Foleshill Women Training project was looking for premises to start the catering enterprise, the vicar of St Paul’s was very active local church partnerships to offer support to management committee members. The community was engaged by holding events to provide information on services available on health and voluntary and statutory services. Women were provided with advice on social benefits, education and work. These were predominately attended by Asian women. Voluntary groups also were encouraged to use the centre as there was an overlap with the services and the people attending.
The Community Mental Health team started support groups and care groups for women and men in here. The advantage of using the venue was that it was not a medical facility and people could go there without any label or stigma attached. It was a safe space for many. The NHS Partnership Trust workers using the church faced some challenges about the Asian community using church premises, as well as equal access to the space by men and women. However, they succeeded in navigating these issues in a culturally sensitive way, and the numbers in attendance kept growing.

This shop offers one such point in the city. It provided a critical node in the local area of Stoney Stanton Road, as a large part of the workforce at GEC included Asian women. In their lunch hour and after work, they would go to the shop to buy clothes, often on credit, to discuss their sorrows and to exchange possibilities. The shop was originally run by Mohinder Kaur and her husband, both of whom held on to an ethic of community service. After her husband passed away at a young age, Mohinder continued to run it, whilst raising four boys. "
Clothing Centre/ Homeworking  ,Meeting Places,"Old Church Road, Foleshill (no longer exists)",52.43942147,-1.483105944,,,,CC_audio2.mp4,,,,,"‘Homeworking was city wide and it was also not just for Asian women. It was for anyone who was working from home. There were a lot of Goriyan (white women) working at that time assembling Christmas crackers, knitting machines and sewing as well, Turkish women in Cheylesmore.’   

Homeworking provided an important avenue of employment for many South Asian women, helping them to contribute to the family income. Lacking child care and skills to enter the formal labour market, they utilised existing skills and turned to textile related work through contacts in the community. However, it was widely recognised that such work was ‘hidden’, and it was labour intensive, low paid, lacked health and safety requirements and provided no opportunities for training and development. Homeworkers lacked any worker rights. Homeworking also added to the never-ending list of chores for women at home.

As work for men shrank in the manufacturing industries across the city, Asian men turned to the textile trade in what was known as the ‘Cut, Make, Trim’ subcontracting attached to London-based fashion companies. The majority of Asian women were highly skilled machinists and pitifully low paid. They worked in cramped conditions with industrial machines in their homes. Ironically, women doing homework spent less time with their children. In fact, children also became involved by helping in the packing and assembly of the garments.

As a way of addressing the situation for all homeworkers, and as part of economic community development strategies in the late 1980s, Coventry city council employed a development worker to design and deliver support and training to homeworkers. For South Asian women, this training was delivered through the organisation Foleshill Women’s Training and the Nay Yug project."
The word 'activism',Other,,52.381,-1.565,,groupphotowebsite.jpeg,,V_audio1.mp4,P_audio1.mp4,I_audio1.ogg,I_audio2.ogg,JT_audio1.mp3,"<p><i>What is an activist? Who is an activist?</i></p>
<p>When we started to talk about <i>‘activism’</i> and being <i>‘activists’</i>, those who were <i>‘pioneers’</i> and involved in mobilisation did not see themselves as activists. This raises the question of who and what is an activist.</p>

<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p>The late 1980s and early 1990s were a period of change for many cities, when European and national government funding enabled those in marginalised communities to access resources to initiate, develop and strengthen provision and activities. Whilst valuing these opportunities, there was much debate and critique of the limitations in vision and implementation, especially the climate of competition this created amongst the least resourced, leading to division and fragmentation. It was also a time when claims for ‘space’ and demands for better treatment were being made by those who continued to be located at the margins, as part of the process of settlement and an assertion of their claim over Coventry as also their home. Within this wider context, women’s lives, needs and rights were often overlooked by ‘community leaders’ and it is within this space that South Asian women played a crucial role in setting up inclusive organisations for women which aimed to build their skills and confidence and to address the issues that confronted them in their everyday lives.</p>

<p>The organisations featured on the map focused on education and training, helping women strengthen their traditional skills and set up businesses and enter professional careers, to support their emotional and mental wellbeing, to bring women together in safe spaces to forge connections with others to end isolation, to go out on trips and organise social activities to bring laughter back to women’s lives, and to provide safe refuge and support for women and children escaping violence and abuse to help them rebuild their lives. These organisations became thriving centres of activity and places of gathering for hundreds of South Asian and other women in the city. They also provided valuable employment for South Asian women, many of whom went on to occupy important positions across the city.</p>

<p>Since the 1990s, much has changed. Some organisations and groups have closed, others have been taken over by new leaderships and gone down different routes to their original vision, and still others have seen newer groups of women enter their doors as the demographics of the city alter through newer migration waves. All the while they continue to provide crucial spaces for women’s growth and development. Change, whether good or bad, is an inevitability of life, especially in a city like Coventry.</p>

<p>‘At that time there was urban funding from the national government for projects to enhance local networks and build skills in community-based projects’. </p>

<p>‘They would give ten weeks in a project, to train in a skill. What’s ten weeks? You learn something and then you are thrown back into the market, so what could they do with it? … We didn’t do that, we were on the ground. But that was never measured’.</p>

<p><i>‘I think it's because the funding is set up in such a way, sort of set up to divide and rule. But the organisations that realised that started networking, partnering, and putting in bids together, setting up steering groups and all that’.</i></p> "

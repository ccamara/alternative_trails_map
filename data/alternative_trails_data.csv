It recognised that women in the community could be supporters and draw on their own experiences to form supportive connections with women.

Supported only for three years, it was Asian women community activists that ensured the project continued beyond this time. Sahil continues to be a source of advice and wellbeing support for many in the city and beyond.

‘We found that they were shutting it up after the three years. Back then when we would talk to the social services, it was always all about targets, there was no other way to measure goals. It was horrible, always talking in numbers, how many women have you gotten to use certain services, sort of labelling people. And we were trying to convince them that the need is still there’.

This shop offers one such point in the city. It provided a critical node in the local area of Stoney Stanton Road, as a large part of the workforce at GEC included Asian women. In their lunch hour and after work, they would go to the shop to buy clothes, often on credit, to discuss their sorrows and to exchange possibilities. The shop was originally run by Mohinder Kaur and her husband, both of whom held on to an ethic of community service. After her husband passed away at a young age, Mohinder continued to run it, whilst raising four boys"
